          My greatest talent is learning. Learning how to program in R by
          querying the web to solve technical problems, I manipulated big data
          and engendered pragmatic graphics that catalyzed executive discussion
          at Idaho Steel Products Inc. to decrease company turnover. My passion
          for learning and my skills in effective communication, conflict
          resolution, and leadership combine to suit me well for positions
          within Human Resources or Data Analytics departments.

          As leader of the Male Body Image Perception research team I dedicated
          myself to fostering a creative atmosphere, specifically during many
          instances of tension between team members. Initially I met with each
          team member to listen to their perspective, and together we identified
          the goal of creating a friendly yet productive atmosphere. I led my
          team in pursuing our goal by emphasizing the use of a team motto that
          reflected this mission, harboring a mindset of creativity that in turn
          spurred excellent research. After months of persistent effort, we
          concluded our research and presented it at the Research and Creative
          Works Conference at Brigham Young University â€“ Idaho to a board of
          professors. Our research was well received and congratulated.

          This experience showcases my skills of engendering creative
          atmospheres, leading a diverse team, and communicating effectively
          with audiences. By working closely alongside each member, I identified
          how the group could make the biggest difference.
        </p>

          Through diligent work I combine my programming acumen and passion for
          learning with my potential to develop as a leader.
