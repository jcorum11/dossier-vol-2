            I have worked to overcome obstacles to become a full stack developer
            graduating from University of Utahâ€™s boot camp near the top of the
            class, earning me a full-stack developer certificate with a background
            in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. I have studied diligently to
            learn and implement React, Redux, and GraphQL. I implemented all three
            of these in a project called Rolodeck where I worked with a team and
            implemented GraphQL for the entire project, programmed a QR scanner in
            React, and implemented Redux for easily transferable data.
