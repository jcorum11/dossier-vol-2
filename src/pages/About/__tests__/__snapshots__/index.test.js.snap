        I have worked to overcome obstacles to become a full stack developer graduating from University of Utahâ€™s boot camp near the top of the class, earning me a full-stack developer certificate with a background in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. I have studied diligently to learn and implement React, Redux, and GraphQL. I implemented all three of these in a project called Rolodeck where I worked with a team and implemented GraphQL for the entire project, programmed a QR scanner in React, and implemented Redux for easily transferable data.
