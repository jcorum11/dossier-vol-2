          I really love baseball cards. Like... I really love them. I made an app in React Native for my friend as a kind of social media for baseball cards. This one doesnt have a link yet but I hope it will soon!

          This is another one that I did with a friend of mine. It too doesnt have a link because we are still working on it, but it is a website for people to sell dogs and pet services that has a really good UI.

          I am really proud of this one. I got a group of friends together and we worked really hard on it. I really loved working with them. You should definitely check this one out.
